this is an Arduino sketch for i2c use. 
The purpose is to extend an Arduino board with another arduino.
The main Arduino board handle software, extended board handle pin.

 ------                         -----            -----
|master| <-------i2c com.----> |Slave|<---i2c-->|slave|<----i2c-   -  ->
|      |                       |     |          |     |
 ------                        -------           -----



1. Software

There are two makefile, one for master and one for the slave.
If you want to use those makefile, you have to install ino and the arduino env.

apt-get install arduino
apt-get install ino


make: compile
make up: upload the hex file to your board (you have to specify the board number inside the makefile
make serial : open a terminal between the board and your computer

ctrl+a ctrlq: close the  terminal (picocom command)
